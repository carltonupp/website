          Hello! My name is <strong>Carlton Upperdine</strong>, and I am a
          Software Engineer currently based in Sheffield, UK.

        <li className="mb-5">
          Throughout my career I have worn many hats, having worked in technical
          capabilities such as Software Engineering, QA, SRE/DevOps, Agile
          Delivery and more recently as a Consultant.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-5">
          I started out my career in the .NET/Microsoft space, but in recent
          years I have had the opportunity to work in a more tech agnostic way
          and have gained experience with languages such as Java, TypeScript and
          Go.
